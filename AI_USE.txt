PDF Report Generator for Downtime Data



B
Create a class called Report Generator that generates a pdf report given the following data pulled from sqlalchemy in the downtime table:
def get_all_data(self):
        session = self.Session()
        data = session.query(Downtime).all()
        session.close()
        return data

    def turn_all_data_into_dataframe(self):
        data = self.get_all_data()
        return pd.DataFrame([vars(downtime) for downtime in data])

Dont worry about formatting just get that data on the page


I'll help you create a simple Report Generator class that uses ReportLab to generate a PDF from your DataFrame.


PDF Report Generator Class
Click to open code
This basic implementation:

Takes your DataFrame and converts it to a PDF table
Includes basic styling for readability
Automatically adjusts to any number of columns in your data
Creates a simple but professional-looking report
To use it with your existing code, you would just need to:

python

Copy
report_gen = ReportGenerator()
df = your_instance.turn_all_data_into_dataframe()
report_gen.generate_report(df)
Would you like me to add any additional features like:

Page headers/footers
Custom formatting for specific columns
Summary statistics
Charts or graphs
Multi-page handling for large datasets
Copy
Retry



B
Now I want to be able to choose where the file is saved to so looking at this functionality, change the functionality so that I can choose where the pdf is saved:
def _handle_button_click(self):
        options = QFileDialog.Options()
        filename,  = QFileDialog.getSaveFileName(self, "Save PDF Report", "", "PDF Files (*.pdf)", options=options)
        if file_name:
            self._generate_empty_pdf(file_name)

    def _generate_empty_pdf(self, file_name):
        downtime_table = Downtime.DowntimeTable()
        report_gen = ReportGenerator("downtime_report.pdf")
        df = downtime_table.turn_all_data_into_dataframe()
        report_gen.generate_report(df)


I'll modify the Report Generator to work with your file dialog code.


PDF Report Generator Class with File Path Selection
Click to open code
Key changes made:

Modified the ReportGenerator to accept a filepath in the constructor
Added a prepare_document method that:
Creates any necessary directories in the file path
Sets up the PDF document with the specified path
Updated the handling of the file path throughout the class
Modified the button click handler to pass the selected file path to the ReportGenerator
Now when you use the file dialog, the PDF will be saved to the location the user selects. The code also ensures that:

The directory structure exists before trying to save the file
The SimpleDocTemplate is created with the correct file path
The file dialog selection is properly used
Would you like me to add any additional features or error handling to this implementation?

Copy

def init(self, filename="downtime_report.pdf"):
        self.filename = filename
        self.doc = SimpleDocTemplate(
            filename,
            pagesize=letter,
            rightMargin=72,
            leftMargin=72,
            topMargin=72,
            bottomMargin=72
        )

Given the SimpleDocTemplate how do I make this landscrape orientation


I'll show you how to modify the SimpleDocTemplate setup to use landscape orientation. You just need to rotate the letter pagesize using landscape from reportlab.lib.pagesizes.


PDF Report Generator with Landscape Orientation
Click to open code
The key change is importing landscape from reportlab.lib.pagesizes and wrapping the letter pagesize with landscape(). This rotates the page 90 degrees, giving you landscape orientation.

If you want to make the orientation configurable, you could modify it like this:

python

Copy
def __init__(self, filename="downtime_report.pdf", use_landscape=True):
    self.filename = filename
    pagesize = landscape(letter) if use_landscape else letter
    self.doc = SimpleDocTemplate(
        filename,
        pagesize=pagesize,
        rightMargin=72,
        leftMargin=72,
        topMargin=72,
        bottomMargin=72
    )
This would allow you to choose the orientation when creating the ReportGenerator instance.

For the following code the attributes of drilling operation or customer name should be attributes of their respective form widget. And when accessed are accessed first through the form from self and t
pasted
B
Understood. Here's the updated code with the attributes of the drilling operation and customer name accessed through their respective form widgets:

python

Copy
def create_order_widget(self):
    self.create_form_widget("Create Work Order", [
        ("Customer ID", QLineEdit(), lambda: self.order_form.customer_id),
        ("Drilling Operation", self.create_combo(["1", "2", "3"]), lambda: self.order_form.drilling_operation),
        ("Start Time", self.create_datetime_edit(), lambda: self.order_form.start_time)
    ], self.submit_order)

def create_customer_widget(self):
    self.create_form_widget("Add Customer", [
        ("Customer Name", QLineEdit(), lambda: self.customer_form.customer_name),
        ("Customer Email", QLineEdit(), lambda: self.customer_form.customer_email),
        ("Customer Address", QLineEdit(), lambda: self.customer_form.customer_address)
    ], self.submit_customer)

def create_form_widget(self, title, fields, submit_action):
    widget = QWidget()
    layout = QVBoxLayout(widget)
    layout.addWidget(QLabel(title))
    
    if title == "Create Work Order":
        self.order_form = widget
    elif title == "Add Customer":
        self.customer_form = widget
    
    for label, field, assign_fn in fields:
        layout.addWidget(QLabel(label))
        layout.addWidget(field)
        assign_fn().set(field)
    
    submit_button = QPushButton(f"Submit {title.split()[0]}")
    submit_button.clicked.connect(submit_action)
    layout.addWidget(submit_button)
    
    self.content_layout.addWidget(widget)

def submit_order(self):
    customer_id = int(self.order_form.customer_id.text())
    if not self.is_valid_customer_id(customer_id):
        return self.show_warning("Invalid Customer ID")
    
    self.order_table.add_order(customer_id, int(self.order_form.drilling_operation.currentText()), self.order_form.start_time.dateTime().toString("yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss"), "Pending", True)
    self.populate_order_table()
    self.clear_fields([self.order_form.customer_id, self.order_form.drilling_operation, self.order_form.start_time])

def submit_customer(self):
    self.customer_table.add_customer(self.customer_form.customer_name.text(), self.customer_form.customer_email.text(), self.customer_form.customer_address.text())
    self.populate_customer_table()
    self.clear_fields([self.customer_form.customer_name, self.customer_form.customer_email, self.customer_form.customer_address])
The key changes are:

In the create_order_widget and create_customer_widget functions, the attribute accesses for customer_id, drilling_operation, start_time, customer_name, customer_email, and customer_address are now made through the respective form widgets (self.order_form and self.customer_form).
In the create_form_widget function, the form widgets are stored in the self.order_form and self.customer_form attributes for later use.
In the submit_order and submit_customer functions, the attribute accesses are updated to use the form widget attributes.
This ensures that the attributes of the drilling operation and customer name are properly encapsulated within their respective form widgets, and can be accessed through the form widget references.

        except:
            QMessageBox.warning(self, "Error", "Failed to delete order")


The code you provided looks good and should work as expected. Here's a breakdown of the functions:

show_warning(self, message):
This function displays a warning message box with the given message.
It also clears the customer_id field after displaying the warning.
clear_fields(self, fields):
This function clears the input fields provided in the fields list.
For QComboBox fields, it sets the current index to 0 (the first item).
For QDateTimeEdit fields, it sets the datetime to the current datetime.
For all other fields, it clears the text.
handle_item_changed(self, item):
This function is called when an item in the order table is changed.
It checks if the column that was changed is one of the editable columns.
It retrieves the work order ID from the first column of the selected row.
It then updates the corresponding property of the order in the order_table based on the column that was changed.
show_context_menu(self, position):
This function is called when the user right-clicks on the order table.
It creates a context menu with a "Delete Order" option.
If the user selects the "Delete Order" option, it calls the confirm_delete_order(self, row) function.
confirm_delete_order(self, row):
This function is called when the user wants to delete an order.
It first checks if the order is already completed, and if so, it displays a warning message and returns.
Otherwise, it displays a confirmation dialog to the user.
If the user confirms, it calls the delete_order(self, order_id, row) function.
delete_order(self, order_id, row):
This function deletes the order with the given order_id from the order_table.
It then removes the corresponding row from the order_table_widget.
If the deletion is successful, it displays a success message. Otherwise, it displays an error message.
Overall, the code handles various aspects of the order management system, including displaying warnings, clearing fields, updating order details, and deleting orders.

def show_warning(self, message):
        QMessageBox.warning(self, "Submission Failed", message)
        self.customer_id.clear()


In this code, the show_warning() function is responsible for displaying a warning message to the user and clearing the customer_id field.

Here's a breakdown of what the function does:

QMessageBox.warning(self, "Submission Failed", message):
This line displays a warning message box with the title "Submission Failed" and the provided message as the content.
The self parameter refers to the current instance of the class that the function is defined in.
self.customer_id.clear():
This line clears the text in the customer_id field, which is an attribute of the current class instance.
The purpose of this function is to provide a way to display a warning message to the user when a submission fails, and to also clear the customer_id field as a way to reset the form.

This function might be called in situations where, for example, the user tries to submit an order with an invalid customer ID. In that case, the show_warning() function would be invoked, displaying a warning message to the user and clearing the customer_id field so that the user can enter a new value.

The show_warning() function is a convenience method that encapsulates the logic for displaying a warning message and clearing a specific field, making it reusable across different parts of the application.

B
But there is no customer_id class instance


You're right, my previous explanation assumed the existence of a customer_id attribute, but the code you provided does not show any such attribute.

Let me re-examine the show_warning() function:

python

Copy
def show_warning(self, message):
    QMessageBox.warning(self, "Submission Failed", message)
    self.customer_id.clear()
Since there is no customer_id attribute shown in the code you provided, the last line self.customer_id.clear() will likely cause an error, as there is no customer_id attribute to clear.

The correct implementation of this function would be:

python

Copy
def show_warning(self, message):
    QMessageBox.warning(self, "Submission Failed", message)
This function simply displays a warning message to the user using the QMessageBox.warning() function, without attempting to clear any fields, since there is no evidence of a customer_id attribute in the code you provided.

Without more context about the rest of the class, I cannot make any assumptions about what customer_id might be referencing. The function should be limited to displaying the warning message and not try to clear any fields, unless you can confirm the existence of a customer_id attribute elsewhere in the code.

The code you provided seems to be a part of a larger application that manages orders and customers. Here's a breakdown of the different components and functions:

OperatorWindow Class:
This class is a subclass of UserWindow and represents the main window for the operator.
It has attributes for customer_table and order_table instances, which are used to interact with the data.
The editable_columns attribute specifies the columns in the order table that are editable.
The setup_ui() method sets up the various widgets and tables in the window.
Table Setup:
The setup_table() method sets up a table with the provided headers, and connects the itemChanged signal to the _handle_item_changed() method if provided.
The create_order_table() and create_customer_table() methods create the respective QTableWidget instances.
The populate_order_table() and populate_customer_table() methods populate the order and customer tables, respectively.
The add_order_row() and add_customer_row() methods add a new row to the order and customer tables, respectively.
Form Widgets:
The create_order_widget() and create_customer_widget() methods create the "Create Work Order" and "Add Customer" form widgets, respectively.
The create_form_widget() method creates a generic form widget with the provided title, fields, and submit action.
The create_combo() and create_datetime_edit() methods create the dropdown and datetime edit widgets, respectively.
Submission Handling:
The submit_order() method handles the submission of a new work order, including validating the customer ID and adding the order to the order_table.
The submit_customer() method handles the submission of a new customer, adding the customer to the customer_table.
The is_valid_customer_id() method checks if the provided customer ID is valid.
Utility Methods:
The show_warning() method displays a warning message to the user and clears the customer_id field.
The clear_fields() method clears the input fields of the provided widgets.
The handle_item_changed() method is called when an item in the order table is edited, and updates the corresponding order in the order_table.
Context Menu and Order Deletion:
The show_context_menu() method sets up a context menu for the order table, with an option to delete the order.
The confirm_delete_order() method checks if the order can be deleted (i.e., if it's not completed) and displays a confirmation dialog.
The delete_order() method deletes the order from the order_table and removes the corresponding row from the order table widget.
Overall, this code provides a user interface for managing orders and customers, with functionality for creating new orders and customers, editing order details, and deleting orders (if they are not completed).

def create_order_widget(self):
        self.create_form_widget("Create Work Order", [

            ("Drilling Operation", self.create_combo(["1", "2", "3"]), lambda: self.order_form.drilling_operation),
            ("Start Time", self.create_datetime_edit(), lambda: self.order_form.start_time)
        ], self.submit_order)
What is this function doing


The create_order_widget() function is responsible for creating the "Create Work Order" form widget in the OperatorWindow class.

Here's a breakdown of what the function does:

self.create_form_widget("Create Work Order", [...], self.submit_order):
This line calls the create_form_widget() method, which creates a new form widget with the title "Create Work Order".
The second argument is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a field in the form:
The first element of the tuple is the label for the field.
The second element is the widget (e.g., QLineEdit, QComboBox, QDateTimeEdit) that will be used for the field.
The third element is a lambda function that returns a reference to the attribute in the order_form widget that corresponds to the field.
The third argument is a reference to the submit_order() method, which will be called when the user submits the form.
The fields in the "Create Work Order" form are:
"Customer ID": A QLineEdit field, where the user can enter the customer ID.
"Drilling Operation": A QComboBox field, where the user can select the drilling operation from a predefined list of options ("1", "2", "3").
"Start Time": A QDateTimeEdit field, where the user can select the start time for the work order.
The lambda functions in the field tuples (lambda: self.order_form.customer_id, lambda: self.order_form.drilling_operation, and lambda: self.order_form.start_time) are used to reference the corresponding attributes in the order_form widget, which is created and stored in the self.order_form attribute when the "Create Work Order" form widget is created.
Overall, the create_order_widget() function sets up the "Create Work Order" form, including the fields and the submit action, and stores a reference to the form widget in the self.order_form attribute for later use, such as in the submit_order() method.

Copy
Retry


B
When used with this function the lambda: self.order_form.customer_id.set(field) causes an error:
def create_form_widget(self, title, fields, submit_action):
        widget = QWidget()
        layout = QVBoxLayout(widget)
        layout.addWidget(QLabel(title))

        if title == "Create Work Order":
            self.order_form = widget
        elif title == "Add Customer":
            self.customer_form = widget

        for label, field, assign_fn in fields:
            layout.addWidget(QLabel(label))
            layout.addWidget(field)
            assign_fn().set(field)

        submit_button = QPushButton(f"Submit {title.split()[0]}")
        submit_button.clicked.connect(submit_action)
        layout.addWidget(submit_button)

        self.content_layout.addWidget(widget)


I see, the issue here is that the assign_fn is a lambda function that returns a reference to the customer_id or drilling_operation attribute, but these attributes are not directly settable.

The correct way to handle this would be to modify the create_form_widget() function to store the references to the form fields in the order_form and customer_form attributes, and then use those references to set the values in the submit_order() and submit_customer() methods.

Here's the updated create_form_widget() function:

python

Copy
def create_form_widget(self, title, fields, submit_action):
    widget = QWidget()
    layout = QVBoxLayout(widget)
    layout.addWidget(QLabel(title))
    
    if title == "Create Work Order":
        self.order_form = widget
        self.order_form.customer_id = None
        self.order_form.drilling_operation = None
        self.order_form.start_time = None
    elif title == "Add Customer":
        self.customer_form = widget
        self.customer_form.customer_name = None
        self.customer_form.customer_email = None
        self.customer_form.customer_address = None
    
    for label, field, assign_fn in fields:
        layout.addWidget(QLabel(label))
        layout.addWidget(field)
        if title == "Create Work Order":
            if label == "Customer ID":
                self.order_form.customer_id = field
            elif label == "Drilling Operation":
                self.order_form.drilling_operation = field
            elif label == "Start Time":
                self.order_form.start_time = field
        elif title == "Add Customer":
            if label == "Customer Name":
                self.customer_form.customer_name = field
            elif label == "Customer Email":
                self.customer_form.customer_email = field
            elif label == "Customer Address":
                self.customer_form.customer_address = field
    
    submit_button = QPushButton(f"Submit {title.split()[0]}")
    submit_button.clicked.connect(submit_action)
    layout.addWidget(submit_button)
    
    self.content_layout.addWidget(widget)
And then, in the submit_order() and submit_customer() methods, you can use the references stored in the order_form and customer_form attributes to get the values:

python

Copy
def submit_order(self):
    customer_id = int(self.order_form.customer_id.text())
    if not self.is_valid_customer_id(customer_id):
        return self.show_warning("Invalid Customer ID")
    
    self.order_table.add_order(
        customer_id,
        int(self.order_form.drilling_operation.currentText()),
        self.order_form.start_time.dateTime().toString("yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss"),
        "Pending",
        True
    )
    self.populate_order_table()
    self.clear_fields([self.order_form.customer_id, self.order_form.drilling_operation, self.order_form.start_time])

def submit_customer(self):
    self.customer_table.add_customer(
        self.customer_form.customer_name.text(),
        self.customer_form.customer_email.text(),
        self.customer_form.customer_address.text()
    )
    self.populate_customer_table()
    self.clear_fields([self.customer_form.customer_name, self.customer_form.customer_email, self.customer_form.customer_address])
This way, the create_form_widget() function stores the references to the form fields in the order_form and customer_form attributes, which can then be used in the submit_order() and submit_customer() methods to access the field values.

Be very carful and give a clear and simple solution


The error occurs because you're trying to mix datetime.timedelta with float values in the sum() function. The issue is in the get_total_downtime_for_date method. Here's the fix:

python

Copy
def get_total_downtime_for_date(self, date):
    session = self.Session()
    date_next_day = date + datetime.timedelta(days=1)
    downtimes = session.query(Downtime).filter(
        Downtime.downtimeStart >= date,
        Downtime.downtimeEnd <= date_next_day
    ).all()
    
    # Convert all downtimes to seconds first, sum them, then convert back to timedelta
    total_seconds = sum(downtime.downtimeDelta.total_seconds() for downtime in downtimes)
    total_downtime = datetime.timedelta(seconds=total_seconds)
    
    session.close()
    return total_downtime
The key changes are:

Removed the datetime.timedelta() from the sum() function
First sum up all the seconds as a float
Then convert the total seconds back to a timedelta at the end
This solves the type mismatch between timedelta and float values that was causing the error.

Given the following code what is the simplest way to allow a user to delete rows from the order table

I'll help you add a simple method to delete orders from the table. Here's a straightforward solution to add to your OrderTable class:

python

Copy
def delete_order(self, order_id: int):
    session = self.Session()
    try:
        order = session.query(Order).filter_by(orderId=order_id).first()
        if order:
            session.delete(order)
            session.commit()
            return True
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        session.rollback()
        raise e
    finally:
        session.close()
This method:

Takes an order_id parameter to identify which order to delete
Uses a try-except block to handle potential errors safely
Returns True if the order was found and deleted, False if the order wasn't found
Includes session.rollback() in case of errors
Always closes the session using finally
You can use it like this:

python

Copy
order_table = OrderTable()
success = order_table.delete_order(123)  # where 123 is the order_id to delete
if success:
    print("Order deleted successfully")
else:
    print("Order not found")
This is the simplest and safest way to implement order deletion while maintaining proper database session handling.

Given this ui, what is the simplest way to allow a user to delete a order row from the table

The simplest way to add order deletion functionality would be to add a right-click context menu or a delete button for each row. Here's how to implement a right-click menu solution:

python

Copy
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMenu

# Add this to the OperatorWindow class after __init__
def _setup_work_order_table(self):
    self.table = QTableWidget(0, 6)
    self.table.horizontalHeader().setSectionResizeMode(QHeaderView.Stretch)
    self.table.setHorizontalHeaderLabels(["Work Order ID", "Customer ID", "Drilling Operation", "Start Time", "Status", "Pass Quality Control"])
    self.table.itemChanged.connect(self._handle_item_changed)
    # Add this line to enable context menu
    self.table.setContextMenuPolicy(Qt.CustomContextMenu)
    self.table.customContextMenuRequested.connect(self._show_context_menu)
    self._populate_work_order_table()
    self.content_layout.addWidget(self.table)

# Add these new methods to the OperatorWindow class
def _show_context_menu(self, position):
    row = self.table.rowAt(position.y())
    if row >= 0:  # Only show menu if user clicked on a row
        menu = QMenu()
        delete_action = menu.addAction("Delete Order")
        action = menu.exec_(self.table.viewport().mapToGlobal(position))
        
        if action == delete_action:
            order_id = int(self.table.item(row, 0).text())
            self._delete_order(order_id, row)

def _delete_order(self, order_id, row):
    reply = QMessageBox.question(self, 'Delete Order', 
                               'Are you sure you want to delete this order?',
                               QMessageBox.Yes | QMessageBox.No, QMessageBox.No)

    if reply == QMessageBox.Yes:
        if self.order_table.delete_order(order_id):
            self.table.removeRow(row)
            QMessageBox.information(self, "Success", "Order deleted successfully")
        else:
            QMessageBox.warning(self, "Error", "Failed to delete order")
This solution:

Adds a right-click context menu to the table
When user right-clicks a row, shows a "Delete Order" option
Asks for confirmation before deleting
Removes the row from the table if deletion is successful
Shows appropriate success/error messages
To use it:

Right-click on any order row in the table
Select "Delete Order" from the menu
Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog
This is the most user-friendly and safest way to implement deletion in the existing UI, as it:

Requires confirmation to prevent accidental deletions
Provides visual feedback
Integrates naturally with the existing table interface
Doesn't require additional UI elements

Edit the following function so that the row cannot be deleted if it is already procced,Status is "Completed":
def _delete_order(self, order_id, row):
        reply = QMessageBox.question(self, 'Delete Order', 
                                'Are you sure you want to delete this order?',
                                QMessageBox.Yes | QMessageBox.No, QMessageBox.No)

        if reply == QMessageBox.Yes:
            try:
                self.order_table.delete_order(order_id)
                self.table.removeRow(row)
                QMessageBox.information(self, "Success", "Order deleted successfully")
            except:
                QMessageBox.warning(self, "Error", "Failed to delete order")


Here's the modified _delete_order function that checks the order status before allowing deletion:

python

Copy
def _delete_order(self, order_id, row):
    # Check the status from the table
    status = self.table.item(row, 4).text()  # Column 4 is Status
    
    if status == "Completed":
        QMessageBox.warning(self, "Cannot Delete", "Completed orders cannot be deleted")
        return
        
    reply = QMessageBox.question(self, 'Delete Order', 
                            'Are you sure you want to delete this order?',
                            QMessageBox.Yes | QMessageBox.No, QMessageBox.No)

    if reply == QMessageBox.Yes:
        try:
            self.order_table.delete_order(order_id)
            self.table.removeRow(row)
            QMessageBox.information(self, "Success", "Order deleted successfully")
        except:
            QMessageBox.warning(self, "Error", "Failed to delete order")
The changes:

Added a check for the order's status at the beginning
If status is "Completed", shows a warning message and returns without deleting
Only proceeds with deletion confirmation if the order is not completed
This ensures that completed orders are protected from deletion while maintaining the existing functionality for non-completed orders.

Edit the following function so that if a row has a "Completed" Status it cannot be edited:
def _handle_item_changed(self, item):
        if item.column() in self.editable_columns:
            row = item.row()
            work_order_id = int(self.table.item(row, 0).text())
            column = item.column()
            new_value = item.text()

            if column == 2:  # Drilling Operation
                self.order_table.update_drilling_operation(work_order_id, int(new_value))
            elif column == 3:  # Start Time
                self.order_table.update_start_time(work_order_id, new_value)
            elif column == 5: # Quality Check
                self.order_table.update_pass_quality_control(work_order_id, new_value.lower() == 'true')


Here's the modified _handle_item_changed function that prevents editing of completed orders:

python

Copy
def _handle_item_changed(self, item):
    if item.column() in self.editable_columns:
        row = item.row()
        status = self.table.item(row, 4).text()  # Get status from column 4
        
        if status == "Completed":
            # Revert the change
            QMessageBox.warning(self, "Cannot Edit", "Completed orders cannot be edited")
            self._populate_work_order_table()  # Refresh the table to revert changes
            return
            
        work_order_id = int(self.table.item(row, 0).text())
        column = item.column()
        new_value = item.text()

        try:
            if column == 2:  # Drilling Operation
                self.order_table.update_drilling_operation(work_order_id, int(new_value))
            elif column == 3:  # Start Time
                self.order_table.update_start_time(work_order_id, new_value)
            elif column == 5:  # Quality Check
                self.order_table.update_pass_quality_control(work_order_id, new_value.lower() == 'true')
        except:
            QMessageBox.warning(self, "Error", "Failed to update order")
            self._populate_work_order_table()  # Refresh the table if update fails
The changes:

Added a check for the status at the beginning
If status is "Completed", shows a warning message and reverts the change
Added try-except block to handle potential update errors
Uses _populate_work_order_table() to revert changes when needed
Added error message for failed updates
This ensures that:

Completed orders cannot be edited
Users get feedback when they try to edit completed orders
The table reverts to its previous state if edits are rejected
Any update errors are handled gracefully
Additionally, you might want to prevent users from even attempting to edit completed orders by modifying the _add_work_order_to_table method:

python

Copy
def _add_work_order_to_table(self, work_order):
    row_idx = self.table.rowCount()
    self.table.insertRow(row_idx)
    items = [
        work_order.orderId,
        work_order.customer_id,
        work_order.drilling_operation,
        work_order.order_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'),
        work_order.status,
        str(work_order.passQualityControl)
    ]
    for col_idx, item in enumerate(items):
        table_item = QTableWidgetItem(str(item))
        # Make all cells in completed orders non-editable
        if work_order.status == "Completed" or col_idx not in self.editable_columns:
            table_item.setFlags(table_item.flags() & ~Qt.ItemIsEditable)
        self.table.setItem(row_idx, col_idx, table_item)
This will visually indicate to users that completed orders cannot be edited by making the cells non-editable in the first place.

Looking at your OPC UA client implementation, there are several potential issues and improvements to consider:


Improved OPC UA Client Implementation
Click to open code
Here are the key issues and improvements I've made to the code:

Error Handling:
Added proper exception handling for connection and subscription operations
Implemented graceful disconnection handling
Added status checking before operations
Resource Management:
Added cleanup of subscriptions before disconnecting
Implemented proper tracking of subscribed nodes
Added method to clear node list
Type Safety:
Added type hints for better code maintainability and IDE support

Renamed Client class to OPCUAClient to avoid naming conflict with opcua.Client
Separated main execution logic into a run() method
Added proper class organization and separation of concerns
Connection Management:
Added connection state tracking
Improved subscription handling with proper cleanup
Added subscription interval as a configurable parameter
String Formatting:
Updated string formatting to use f-strings for better readability
Improved node address formatting
Potential Issues Addressed:
Fixed potential memory leak from not cleaning up subscriptions
Added proper initialization of subscription and node references

Show me the code that does this "Added proper initialization of subscription and node references"


Here are the specific parts of the code that handle proper initialization of subscription and node references:

In the Node class, I added explicit initialization of OPC node and subscription references:
python

Copy
class Node:
    def __init__(self, datablock: str, tag_name: str, ns_number: int = 3):
        # ... other initializations ...
        self.opc_node: Optional[OPCNode] = None        # Initialize OPC node reference
        self.subscription_handle = None                 # Initialize subscription handle
In the OPCUAClient class, I added tracking of subscription and subscribed nodes:
python

Copy
class OPCUAClient:
    def __init__(self, ip_address: str, subscription_interval: int = 500):
        # ... other initializations ...
        self.subscription: Optional[Subscription] = None  # Initialize subscription reference
        self._subscribed_nodes: List[Node] = []          # Track subscribed nodes

    def subscribe_nodes(self, handler: SubHandler) -> None:
        if not self._connected:
            raise ConnectionError("Client not connected")

        try:
            self.subscription = self.client.create_subscription(
                self.subscription_interval, 
                handler
            )
            
            for node in NodeList.get_nodes():
                try:
                    # Initialize the OPC node reference
                    node.opc_node = self.client.get_node(node.address)
                    # Store the subscription handle
                    node.subscription_handle = self.subscription.subscribe_data_change(node.opc_node)
                    # Track the subscribed node
                    self._subscribed_nodes.append(node)
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Failed to subscribe to node {node.address}: {e}")
These changes are important because:

They ensure we're tracking all resources that need cleanup
They make it clear when a node is successfully subscribed
They allow for proper error handling if node initialization fails
They make it possible to properly clean up subscriptions later
Without these initializations, you could run into issues like:

Memory leaks from untracked subscriptions
Inability to properly clean up resources
Difficulty debugging subscription failures
No way to tell if a node was successfully subscribed

        try:
            cursor = self.cnx.cursor()
            with open(fileName, "r") as infile:

Traceback (most recent call last):

    with open(fileName, "r") as infile:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'assignPython/order.ddl'


The error you're encountering is a file path issue. The program is unable to find the file "order.ddl" at the specified path "assignPython/order.ddl". This is happening because:

The path is using forward slashes (/) but you're on Windows which typically uses backslashes ()
The relative path might not be correct relative to where the script is being executed
Here are a few ways to fix this:

Use raw string or escaped backslashes for Windows paths:
python

Copy
fileName = r"assignPython\order.ddl"  # raw string
# or
fileName = "assignPython\\order.ddl"  # escaped backslashes
Use os.path.join() for cross-platform compatibility:
python

Copy
import os
fileName = os.path.join("assignPython", "order.ddl")
Use absolute path (make sure to use the correct path on your system):
python

Copy
fileName = r"c:\Users\birdl\Desktop\Year 5\Term 1\COSC 304\cosc304_lab6\lab6\assignPython\order.ddl"
Check if the file exists before trying to open it:
python

Copy
import os

def init(self):
    """Creates and initializes the database"""
    fileName = os.path.join("assignPython", "order.ddl")
    
    if not os.path.exists(fileName):
        print(f"Error: File not found at: {fileName}")
        print(f"Current working directory: {os.getcwd()}")
        return
        
    try:
        cursor = self.cnx.cursor()
        with open(fileName, "r") as infile:
            # rest of your code
To debug this:

Verify that the file exists in the correct location
Print your current working directory to see where Python is looking for the file:
python

Copy
import os
print(os.getcwd())
Make sure the file name and path are exactly correct (including case sensitivity)
You might also want to check if the file actually exists in the right location relative to where you're running the script from. Sometimes the issue can be that you're running the script from a different directory than you expect.

Handling Invalid Datetime Strings

ValueError: time data '2001-10-21 24:00:00' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'

    raise ValueError("time data %r does not match format %r" %
ValueError: time data '2024-10-21 24:00:00' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'


This error is occurring because '24:00:00' is not a valid time in 24-hour format - hours should be between 00 and 23. In datetime formatting, midnight can be represented as either '00:00:00' (start of day) or '23:59:59' (end of day).

Here's a solution to handle this:

python

Copy
def normalize_datetime_string(datetime_str):
    """
    Normalize datetime string by converting 24:00:00 to the next day at 00:00:00
    """
    if datetime_str.endswith(' 24:00:00'):
        # Parse the date part
        date_part = datetime.strptime(datetime_str.split(' ')[0], '%Y-%m-%d')
        # Add one day and set time to 00:00:00
        next_day = date_part + timedelta(days=1)
        return next_day.strftime('%Y-%m-%d 00:00:00')
    return datetime_str

# Usage in your code:
try:
    normalized_time = normalize_datetime_string(new_start_time)
    order.order_date = datetime.strptime(normalized_time, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error parsing date: {e}")
This solution will:

Check if the time ends with '24:00:00'
If it does, convert it to 00:00:00 of the next day
If it doesn't, leave it unchanged
You might also want to add validation to ensure the time portion is always valid (00:00:00 to 23:59:59) before attempting to parse it.

Would you like me to show you how to add more comprehensive datetime validation?

AttributeError: module 'datetime' has no attribute 'strptime'


This error occurs because you're trying to use strptime directly from the datetime module, but you need to import it correctly. Here's how to fix it:

You have two options:

Import the datetime class specifically:
python

Copy
from datetime import datetime

# Then use:
datetime.strptime(order_date, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
OR

Use the full module path:
python

Copy
import datetime

# Then use:
datetime.datetime.strptime(order_date, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
Based on your traceback, you should modify your Order.py file. Here's how the imports should look at the top of the file:

python

Copy
from datetime import datetime, timedelta  # This is the recommended way

# Then in your add_order method:
def add_order(self, customer_id, drilling_operation, order_date, status, is_active):
    return Order(
        customer_id=customer_id,
        drilling_operation=drilling_operation,
        order_date=datetime.strptime(order_date, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'),
        status=status,
        is_active=is_active
    )
This should resolve the AttributeError you're seeing. Let me know if you need any clarification!

Converting SQLite to SQLAlchemy

B
Can you convert the following so that it uses sqlalchemy:
import sqlite3
from data import DatabaseConnector
import sqlalchemy

class EmployeeTable:
    def init(self):
        self.connection = DatabaseConnector.Database.get_connection()
        self.create_table()

    def create_table(self):

        #check if a table called orders is in the database
        if self.connection.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='employee';").fetchone() is None:
            self.connection.execute(
                'CREATE TABLE employee ('
                'employeeId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,'
                'name TEXT NOT NULL,'
                'username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,'
                'password TEXT NOT NULL,'
                'role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ("Manager", "Technician", "Operator"))'
                ')'
            )
            self.connection.commit()

    def add_employee(self, name: str, username: str, password: str, role: str,):
        self.connection.execute(
            'INSERT INTO employee (name, username, password, role) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)',
            (name, username, password, role)
        )

    def get_employee_details(self):
        return self.connection.execute('SELECT employeeID, name, role FROM employee').fetchall()


Certainly! I'll convert the given code to use SQLAlchemy. This will involve creating a SQLAlchemy model for the Employee table and updating the methods to use SQLAlchemy's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) instead of raw SQL queries.


EmployeeTable using SQLAlchemy
Click to open code
Here's an explanation of the major changes:

We've defined an Employee model using SQLAlchemy's declarative base. This model represents the structure of the employee table.
The EmployeeTable class now uses SQLAlchemy's create_engine and sessionmaker to manage database connections and sessions.
The create_table method now uses SQLAlchemy's metadata to create the table if it doesn't exist.
All methods now use SQLAlchemy's ORM query API instead of raw SQL queries.
We're assuming that DatabaseConnector.Database.get_connection_string() returns a valid SQLAlchemy connection string. You might need to modify this part depending on how your DatabaseConnector is implemented.
Session management (creating and closing sessions) is now handled explicitly in each method.
This implementation provides the same functionality as the original code but uses SQLAlchemy's ORM, which offers better abstraction and more powerful querying capabilities. It also provides better security against SQL injection by using parameterized queries.

Note that this code assumes that the password is stored in plain text, which is not recommended for security reasons. In a production environment, you should use proper password hashing techniques.

Modify the following class to work with the new sqlalchemy sqlite Order databse class:

Certainly! I'll modify the OperatorWindow class to work with the new SQLAlchemy-based Order database class. The main changes will be in how we interact with the database, particularly in the methods that add, retrieve, and update orders.


OperatorWindow using SQLAlchemy Order database
Click to open code
Here are the key changes made to the OperatorWindow class to work with the new SQLAlchemy-based Order database class:

Import changes:
Removed from data import Order
Added from data import OrderTable
In the __init__ method:
Changed self.order_table = Order.OrderTable() to self.order_table = OrderTable()
In the _add_work_order_to_table method:
Modified to work with SQLAlchemy Order objects instead of tuples
Explicitly access attributes of the work_order object
Convert the order_date to a string for display
In the _submit_work_order method:
After adding the new order, retrieve it from the database using get_all_orders()[-1]
Pass this new order object to _add_work_order_to_table
In the _handle_item_changed method:
For the Quality Check update, convert the new value to a boolean
The rest of the class remains largely unchanged, as the OrderTable methods we're calling have the same names and signatures as before. However, they now interact with the SQLAlchemy database backend instead of raw SQL.

This updated OperatorWindow class should now work seamlessly with your new SQLAlchemy-based Order database class. It maintains the same functionality as before but now leverages the power and flexibility of SQLAlchemy for database operations.

Translate the following function for the new Employee table:
def _populate_employee_table(self):
        employees = self.employee_table.get_employee_details()

        self.table.setRowCount(len(employees))
        for row_idx, (emp_id, name, role) in enumerate(employees):
            self.table.setItem(row_idx, 0, QTableWidgetItem(str(emp_id)))
            self.table.setItem(row_idx, 1, QTableWidgetItem(name))
            self.table.setItem(row_idx, 2, QTableWidgetItem(role))


Certainly! I'll translate the _populate_employee_table function to work with the new SQLAlchemy-based Employee table. The main change will be in how we handle the data returned by get_employee_details(), as it will now return SQLAlchemy model objects instead of tuples.

Here's the translated function:

python

Copy
def _populate_employee_table(self):
    employees = self.employee_table.get_employee_details()
    
    self.table.setRowCount(len(employees))
    for row_idx, employee in enumerate(employees):
        self.table.setItem(row_idx, 0, QTableWidgetItem(str(employee.employeeId)))
        self.table.setItem(row_idx, 1, QTableWidgetItem(employee.name))
        self.table.setItem(row_idx, 2, QTableWidgetItem(employee.role))
Here's an explanation of the changes:

The get_employee_details() method now returns a list of SQLAlchemy Employee objects instead of tuples.
In the loop, we now iterate over employees directly, with each employee being a SQLAlchemy Employee object.
Instead of unpacking a tuple (emp_id, name, role), we now access the attributes of the employee object directly:
employee.employeeId instead of emp_id
employee.name instead of name
employee.role instead of role
The rest of the function remains the same, as we're still setting up the QTableWidgetItems in the same way.
This updated function will work with the new SQLAlchemy-based Employee table while maintaining the same functionality in the UI. It populates the table with employee details, just as before, but now it's compatible with the new database structure.

Remember to ensure that your EmployeeTable class (which I assume is what self.employee_table refers to) has been updated to work with SQLAlchemy as well. The get_employee_details() method in that class should return SQLAlchemy Employee objects for this function to work correctly.

Is there anything else you'd like me to explain or modify regarding this function or its integration with the new SQLAlchemy structure?

                'downtimeReason TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (downtimeReason IN ("Machine Fault", "Product Malfunction", "Labour Incident")),'
                'status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ("Pending", "Resolved"))'
                ')'
            )
            self.connection.commit()

    def add_downtime(self, employeeId: int, downtimeReason: str):
        self.connection.execute(
            'INSERT INTO downtime (employeeId, downtimeReason, status) VALUES (?, ?, ?)',
            (employeeId, downtimeReason, 'Pending')
        )
        self.connection.commit()

    def get_last_row(self):
        return self.connection.execute('SELECT * FROM downtime ORDER BY downtimeId DESC LIMIT 1').fetchone()

    def is_currently_downtime(self):
        return self.get_last_row_status() == 'Pending'

    def get_last_row_status(self):
        return self.connection.execute('SELECT status FROM downtime ORDER BY downtimeId DESC LIMIT 1').fetchone()[0]

    def get_last_row_reason(self):
        return self.connection.execute('SELECT downtimeReason FROM downtime ORDER BY downtimeId DESC LIMIT 1').fetchone()[0]

    def end_downtime(self):
        self.connection.execute('UPDATE downtime SET status = "Resolved" WHERE downtimeId = (SELECT MAX(downtimeId) FROM downtime)')
        self.connection.commit()


Certainly! I'll convert this DowntimeTable class to use SQLAlchemy instead of raw SQL queries. This will involve creating a SQLAlchemy model for the Downtime table and updating the methods to use SQLAlchemy's ORM.


DowntimeTable using SQLAlchemy
Click to open code
Here's an explanation of the major changes:

We've defined a Downtime model using SQLAlchemy's declarative base. This model represents the structure of the downtime table.
The DowntimeTable class now uses SQLAlchemy's create_engine and sessionmaker to manage database connections and sessions.
The create_table method now uses SQLAlchemy's metadata to create the table if it doesn't exist.
All methods now use SQLAlchemy's ORM query API instead of raw SQL queries.
We're assuming that DatabaseConnector.Database.get_connection_string() returns a valid SQLAlchemy connection string. You might need to modify this part depending on how your DatabaseConnector is implemented.
Session management (creating and closing sessions) is now handled explicitly in each method.
The downtimeReason and status fields are now Enum types in the SQLAlchemy model, which enforces the CHECK constraints from the original SQL.
The get_last_row, get_last_row_status, and get_last_row_reason methods now return attributes of the Downtime object instead of tuple elements.
The end_downtime method now queries for the last downtime entry and updates its status to 'Resolved'.
This implementation provides the same functionality as the original code but uses SQLAlchemy's ORM, which offers better abstraction and more powerful querying capabilities. It also provides better security against SQL injection by using parameterized queries.

Would you like me to explain any part of this code in more detail?

Certainly! I'll modify the MaintenanceTechnicianWindow class to work with the new SQLAlchemy-based DowntimeTable class. The main changes will be in how we interact with the downtime database, particularly in the methods that add, retrieve, and update downtime records.


MaintenanceTechnicianWindow using SQLAlchemy Downtime database
Click to open code
Here are the key changes made to the MaintenanceTechnicianWindow class to work with the new SQLAlchemy-based DowntimeTable class:

Import changes:
Changed from data import Downtime to from data import DowntimeTable
In the __init__ method:
Changed self.downtime = Downtime.DowntimeTable() to self.downtime = DowntimeTable()
In the update_downtime_display method:
Instead of calling get_last_row_reason() and get_last_row_status() separately, we now call get_last_row() once to get the entire Downtime object.
We then access the downtimeReason and status attributes of this object directly.
The rest of the class remains largely unchanged, as the DowntimeTable methods we're calling have the same names and signatures as before. However, they now interact with the SQLAlchemy database backend instead of raw SQL.

This updated MaintenanceTechnicianWindow class should now work seamlessly with your new SQLAlchemy-based DowntimeTable class. It maintains the same functionality as before but now leverages the power and flexibility of SQLAlchemy for database operations.

The changes are minimal because most of the database interaction logic is encapsulated within the DowntimeTable class. This is a good example of how using proper abstraction can make it easier to change the underlying implementation (in this case, switching from raw SQL to SQLAlchemy) without having to make major changes to the classes that use it.

Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?

Troubleshooting Uninitialized Order Table in OperatorWindow



B
For the following code why do I get the error   File "c:\Users\birdl\Desktop\Year 5\Term 1\MANF 455\Project\MANF455\src\ui\OperatorWindow.py", line 24, in setupwork_order_table
    self._populate_work_order_table()
  File "c:\Users\birdl\Desktop\Year 5\Term 1\MANF 455\Project\MANF455\src\ui\OperatorWindow.py", line 28, in populatework_order_table
    work_orders = self.order_table.get_all_orders()
AttributeError: 'OperatorWindow' object has no attribute 'order_table'

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import (QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QLabel, QLineEdit,
                             QComboBox, QDateTimeEdit, QPushButton, QTableWidget, QTableWidgetItem, QHeaderView)
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt
from data2 import Order

from ui.UserWindow import UserWindow

class OperatorWindow(UserWindow):
    def init(self, employee_id, employee_name):
        super().init(employee_id, employee_name)
        self.order_table = Order.OrderTable()
        self.editable_columns = [2, 3, 5]  # Drilling Operation, Start Time, and Pass Quality Control are editable
        self._init_ui()

    def _init_ui(self):
        self._setup_work_order_table()
        self._create_work_order_widget()

    def _setup_work_order_table(self):
        self.table = QTableWidget(0, 6)
        self.table.horizontalHeader().setSectionResizeMode(QHeaderView.Stretch)
        self.table.setHorizontalHeaderLabels(["Work Order ID", "Customer ID", "Drilling Operation", "Start Time", "Status", "Pass Quality Control"])
        self.table.itemChanged.connect(self._handle_item_changed)
        self._populate_work_order_table()
        self.content_layout.addWidget(self.table)

    def _populate_work_order_table(self):

        for work_order in work_orders:
            self._add_work_order_to_table(work_order)


The error you're encountering suggests that the OperatorWindow object doesn't have an attribute named order_table. This is likely because you're trying to access self.order_table before it has been initialized. Let's take a closer look at your code and suggest a fix:

In your __init__ method, you're creating self.order_table:
python

Copy
def __init__(self, employee_id, employee_name):
    super().__init__(employee_id, employee_name)
    self.order_table = Order.OrderTable()
    # ...
However, in the same method, you're calling self._init_ui(), which in turn calls self._setup_work_order_table(), which then calls self._populate_work_order_table().
Inside _populate_work_order_table(), you're trying to access self.order_table.
The problem is that the _populate_work_order_table() method is being called before self.order_table is initialized. To fix this, you should rearrange the order of operations in your __init__ method. Here's a suggested fix:

python

Copy
class OperatorWindow(UserWindow):
    def __init__(self, employee_id, employee_name):
        super().__init__(employee_id, employee_name)
        self.order_table = Order.OrderTable()
        self.editable_columns = [2, 3, 5]
        self._init_ui()

    def _init_ui(self):
        self._create_work_order_widget()
        self._setup_work_order_table()  # Move this after creating the order_table

    def _setup_work_order_table(self):
        self.table = QTableWidget(0, 6)
        self.table.horizontalHeader().setSectionResizeMode(QHeaderView.Stretch)
        self.table.setHorizontalHeaderLabels(["Work Order ID", "Customer ID", "Drilling Operation", "Start Time", "Status", "Pass Quality Control"])
        self.table.itemChanged.connect(self._handle_item_changed)
        self._populate_work_order_table()
        self.content_layout.addWidget(self.table)

    def _populate_work_order_table(self):
        work_orders = self.order_table.get_all_orders()
        for work_order in work_orders:
            self._add_work_order_to_table(work_order)
The key changes are:

We keep the initialization of self.order_table in the __init__ method.
In _init_ui, we call self._create_work_order_widget() before self._setup_work_order_table().
This ensures that self.order_table is properly initialized before any method tries to use it.

If you're still encountering issues after making these changes, please provide more context about the Order class and the OrderTable class, as well as the implementation of the _create_work_order_widget method.

Singleton SQLite Database for Desktop Apps



B
Using sqlite and a desktop application that may be opened and closed many times how do I create a database class that once initialized will always return the same database?


To create a database class that always returns the same database instance when initialized, even across multiple openings and closings of a desktop application, you can use the Singleton pattern combined with SQLite. Here's a Python implementation that achieves this:


Singleton SQLite Database Class
Click to open code
This SingletonDatabase class ensures that only one instance of the database connection is created and used throughout the lifetime of your application. Here's how it works:

The __new__ method checks if an instance already exists. If not, it creates one.
The __init__ method ensures a connection is established when the instance is initialized.
The connect method creates a new connection if one doesn't exist.
The create_tables method sets up the database schema if it's a new database.
The close method closes the connection when needed.
The __del__ method ensures the connection is closed when the object is destroyed.
To use this class in your desktop application:

python

Copy
db = SingletonDatabase("path/to/your/database.db")

# Use the database
db.execute_query("INSERT INTO example_table (name) VALUES (?)", ("John Doe",))
db.commit()

# Later in the application or in another session
db2 = SingletonDatabase("path/to/your/database.db")
# db2 is the same instance as db
This approach ensures that:

Only one database connection is active at a time.
The connection is reused across multiple initializations.
The database file is created if it doesn't exist.
The connection is properly closed when the application exits.
Remember to call db.close() when you're completely done with the database, typically when your application is closing.

Would you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail?

This code is far to complicated I need a much simpler solution


I apologize for the complexity. You're right, we can simplify this significantly. Let's create a more straightforward solution that still maintains a single database connection across multiple uses.


Simple SQLite Database Class
Click to open code
This simplified Database class provides a much more straightforward solution. Here's how it works:

We use a class variable _connection to store the SQLite connection.
The get_connection class method creates a connection if one doesn't exist, or returns the existing connection.
The close_connection class method closes the connection when you're done with the database.
To use this in your desktop application:

python

Copy
# To get a connection (creates one if it doesn't exist)
conn = Database.get_connection("path/to/your/database.db")

# Use the connection
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)")
conn.commit()

# Later in the application or in another session
conn = Database.get_connection("path/to/your/database.db")
# This will return the same connection object

# When you're done with the database (e.g., when closing the application)
Database.close_connection()
This approach ensures that:

Only one database connection is created and reused.
The implementation is simple and easy to understand.
You can easily get the same connection throughout your application.
Remember to call Database.close_connection() when your application is closing to properly clean up the database connection.

Is this simpler approach more in line with what you were looking for? Would you like me to explain any part of it further?

Local Desktop App with PyQt GUI and SQLite Database

1


Software Requirments Specification for Manufacturing Execution System MANF 455 Heanan Bird #88652318 Phillip Michl #54146543 Logan Gilroy #23385297 School of Eng
pasted
B
Given the following software requirements specification: Help me build out the classes and overall structure for a desktop application that must only run localy built with a Python PyQt GUI and a sqlite database

Certainly! I'll help you design the overall structure and classes for a desktop application based on the software requirements specification (SRS) you provided. We'll use Python with PyQt for the GUI and SQLite for the local database. Let's break this down into main components and classes.


MES Application Structure
Click to open code
This structure provides a solid foundation for your Manufacturing Execution System (MES) application. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

Database: Handles all database operations using SQLite.
WorkOrder: Represents a work order in the system.
Customer: Represents a customer in the system.
MaintenanceReport: Represents a maintenance report.
User: Represents a user of the system (Operator, Maintenance Technician, or Manager).
MESLogic: Contains the core business logic of the MES.
MainWindow: The main GUI window of the application.
To further develop this application, you'll need to:

Implement the database methods to create tables and perform CRUD operations.
Expand the MESLogic class to include all required functionality (e.g., scheduling, OEE calculation, report generation).
Design and implement the GUI using PyQt, creating different views for different user roles.
Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
Add error handling and logging throughout the application.
Would you like me to expand on any specific part of this structure or provide more detailed implementation for any of the classes?

Using python PyQt library how do I make mutliple different templates for user classes and then how do I have the main_window show those tempaltes based on logic


Certainly! I'll show you how to create multiple templates for different user classes using PyQt and how to display them in the main window based on logic. This approach uses QStackedWidget to manage multiple "pages" or templates within the main window.


PyQt User Templates Implementation
Click to open code
This code demonstrates how to create multiple templates for different user classes and switch between them in the main window. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Template Classes: We create separate classes for each user type (OperatorTemplate, TechnicianTemplate, ManagerTemplate). Each class is a QWidget with its own layout and widgets specific to that user type.
MainWindow Class: This is the main application window. It uses a QStackedWidget to manage the different templates.
show_template Method: This method in the MainWindow class is responsible for switching between templates based on the user type.
Demonstration Buttons: For demonstration purposes, we've added buttons to switch between templates. In a real application, you'd typically do this based on user authentication.
To use this in your MES application:

Replace the placeholder widgets in each template with the actual widgets and functionality required for each user type.
Instead of using buttons to switch templates, you would typically do this after user authentication. For example:
python

Copy
def login(self, username, password):
    user = authenticate(username, password)  # Your authentication logic here
    if user:
        if user.role == "operator":
            self.show_template("operator")
        elif user.role == "technician":
            self.show_template("technician")
        elif user.role == "manager":
            self.show_template("manager")
    else:
        # Show login error
You can add more complex logic to handle permissions within each template. For example, you might disable certain buttons or hide certain widgets based on specific user permissions.
Consider adding a logout function that returns to a login screen or a default template.
This structure allows you to easily manage different views for different user types while keeping all the templates within a single main window. It's flexible and can be expanded as your application grows.

Would you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail or show you how to implement any specific functionality within these templates?

Add a sign in template to what you have already generated that is the first thing that is displayed


Certainly! I'll add a sign-in template to the existing structure and make it the first thing displayed when the application starts.


PyQt User Templates Implementation with Sign-In
Click to open code
I've made the following changes to incorporate a sign-in template:

Added a new SignInTemplate class:
This template includes input fields for username and password, and a sign-in button.
Modified the MainWindow class:
Added the SignInTemplate to the stacked widget.
Set the initial view to the sign-in template.
Connected the sign-in button to an authenticate method.
Added an authenticate method to MainWindow:
This method checks the entered username and password.
If authentication is successful, it calls show_template with the appropriate user type.
If authentication fails, it shows an error message.
Removed the demo buttons for switching templates, as this is now handled by the authentication process.
Here's how the flow works now:

When the application starts, the sign-in template is displayed.
The user enters their username and password and clicks the sign-in button.
The authenticate method checks the credentials:
For this example, I've used placeholder credentials:
Username: "operator", "technician", or "manager"
Password: "password" for all users
In a real application, you'd replace this with your actual authentication system.
If authentication is successful, the appropriate template is displayed based on the user type.
If authentication fails, an error message is shown and the user remains on the sign-in template.
To use this in your MES application:

Replace the placeholder authentication logic in the authenticate method with your actual authentication system.
You may want to add a logout functionality that returns the user to the sign-in template.
Consider adding session management to keep track of the logged-in user.
Enhance security by hashing passwords and using secure authentication practices.
Would you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail or show you how to implement any specific functionality within these templates?

For the following code I keep getting this error:
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout, QPushButton, QLabel, QStackedWidget, QLineEdit, QMessageBox
import sys

import SignInWindow
import OperatorWindow
import ManagerWindow
import MaintenanceTechnicianWindow


I apologize for the confusion. It seems like you're trying to import separate modules for different windows, but you're encountering an error. To help you resolve this, could you please provide the following information:

The exact error message you're receiving
The directory structure of your project
The contents of the SignInWindow.py, OperatorWindow.py, ManagerWindow.py, and MaintenanceTechnicianWindow.py files (if they exist)
Without this information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the error. However, I can provide some general guidance on how to structure your code using separate files for different windows.

Here's an example of how you might structure your project:


MES Project Structure with Multiple Windows
Click to open code
This structure separates each window into its own file, making the code more modular and easier to maintain. Here's a breakdown of the files:

main.py: This is the entry point of your application. It creates the main window and manages the different sub-windows.
SignInWindow.py: Contains the SignInWindow class, which handles user authentication.
OperatorWindow.py: Contains the OperatorWindow class for the operator interface.
ManagerWindow.py: Contains the ManagerWindow class for the manager interface.
MaintenanceTechnicianWindow.py: Contains the MaintenanceTechnicianWindow class for the maintenance technician interface.
To use this structure:

Create a new directory for your project.
Create separate .py files for each of the above components.
Copy the code from the artifact into each respective file.
Run main.py to start your application.
If you're still encountering errors, please provide the specific error message and ensure that all the files are in the same directory and named correctly. Also, make sure you have PyQt5 installed (pip install PyQt5 if you haven't already).

Let me know if you need any further clarification or if you're still experiencing issues!

import SignInWindow.py
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'SignInWindow'. How might I fix this error by importing in another way


I understand you're encountering a ModuleNotFoundError when trying to import SignInWindow.py. This error typically occurs when Python can't find the module you're trying to import. Let's address this issue by exploring alternative import methods and ensuring your project structure is correct.


Python Import Methods for Local Modules
Click to open code
To resolve your import issue, try the following steps:

Verify File Location: Ensure that SignInWindow.py is in the same directory as your main script. If it's not, move it there or adjust your import statement accordingly.
Remove .py Extension: When importing, don't include the .py extension. Use import SignInWindow instead of import SignInWindow.py.
Try Different Import Methods: Experiment with the different import methods shown in the artifact above. Start with Method 1, and if that doesn't work, try the others.
Check File Naming: Ensure there are no typos in the filename. Python module names are case-sensitive.
Verify Python Path: Make sure the directory containing SignInWindow.py is in your Python path. You can add it using Method 3 in the artifact.
Use Absolute Imports: If your project has a complex structure, consider using absolute imports. For example:
python

Copy
from your_project_name.windows.SignInWindow import SignInWindow
Create an init.py File: If you're using a package structure, create an empty init.py file in the same directory as SignInWindow.py. This marks the directory as a Python package.
Use importlib (Advanced): As a last resort, you can use the importlib method (Method 5 in the artifact) which can be helpful in certain complex scenarios.
Here's a step-by-step troubleshooting process:

First, try the simple import:
python

Copy
from SignInWindow import SignInWindow
If that doesn't work, try adding the directory to sys.path:
python

Copy
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))
from SignInWindow import SignInWindow
If you're still having issues, print out sys.path to see which directories Python is searching:
python

Copy
import sys
print(sys.path)
Ensure that the directory containing SignInWindow.py is listed.
If all else fails, you might need to restructure your project or use a more advanced import method like importlib.
Remember, the key is to ensure that Python can find your SignInWindow.py file. The most common issue is that the file is not in a location that Python is searching.

Let me know if you need any clarification on these methods or if you're still encountering issues after trying them!

Given the code you have provided already. I need to make a sqlite database for a number of different tables including Operators, Customer, Orders, etc. How can I structure my classes, specifically my python code, to facilitate creating, accessing, and editing these tables so that the code follows good Software engineering principles, encapslation, abstraction, and readability, and reduced redundancy?


Certainly! I'll help you structure your Python code to create, access, and edit SQLite database tables for your Manufacturing Execution System (MES) while following good software engineering principles. We'll use classes to encapsulate database operations, provide abstraction, and reduce redundancy.


MES Database Structure and Operations
Click to open code
This structure follows good software engineering principles:

Encapsulation: Each class encapsulates its data and operations. The DatabaseManager handles the connection, while each Table subclass manages operations for a specific table.
Abstraction: The Table class provides a high-level interface for common database operations, abstracting away the SQL queries.
Inheritance: Specific table classes (Operators, Customers, Orders) inherit from the Table class, reducing code duplication.
Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has a single responsibility. For example, the DatabaseManager manages the database connection, while each Table subclass manages operations for a specific table.
Open/Closed Principle: The structure is open for extension (you can easily add new table classes) but closed for modification (you don't need to change existing classes to add new functionality).
Dependency Injection: The DatabaseManager is injected into each Table instance, allowing for easier testing and flexibility.
Type Hinting: Python type hints are used to improve code readability and catch potential type-related errors early.
Context Manager: The DatabaseManager uses Python's context manager protocol (enter and exit) to ensure proper handling of database connections.
To use this structure in your MES application:

Create a new file, e.g., database.py, and paste the code from the artifact.
In your main application file, import and use the MESDatabase class:
python

Copy
from database import MESDatabase

class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.db = MESDatabase("mes.db")
        # ... rest of your initialization code ...

    def create_work_order(self, customer_id, operator_id):
        self.db.orders.insert({
            'customer_id': customer_id,
            'operator_id': operator_id,
            'order_date': '2024-10-08',  # You might want to use a current date here
            'status': 'Pending'
        })

    def get_pending_orders(self):
        return self.db.orders.select({'status': 'Pending'})

    # ... other methods using the database ...
This structure allows you to easily perform database operations while keeping your code organized and following good software engineering principles. You can extend it by adding more table classes as needed for your MES application.

Would you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail or show you how to integrate it with your existing PyQt GUI code?

Singleton SQLite Database for Desktop Apps



B
Using sqlite and a desktop application that may be opened and closed many times how do I create a database class that once initialized will always return the same database?


To create a database class that always returns the same database instance when initialized, even across multiple openings and closings of a desktop application, you can use the Singleton pattern combined with SQLite. Here's a Python implementation that achieves this:


Singleton SQLite Database Class
Click to open code
This SingletonDatabase class ensures that only one instance of the database connection is created and used throughout the lifetime of your application. Here's how it works:

The __new__ method checks if an instance already exists. If not, it creates one.
The __init__ method ensures a connection is established when the instance is initialized.
The connect method creates a new connection if one doesn't exist.
The create_tables method sets up the database schema if it's a new database.
The close method closes the connection when needed.
The __del__ method ensures the connection is closed when the object is destroyed.
To use this class in your desktop application:

python

Copy
db = SingletonDatabase("path/to/your/database.db")

# Use the database
db.execute_query("INSERT INTO example_table (name) VALUES (?)", ("John Doe",))
db.commit()

# Later in the application or in another session
db2 = SingletonDatabase("path/to/your/database.db")
# db2 is the same instance as db
This approach ensures that:

Only one database connection is active at a time.
The connection is reused across multiple initializations.
The database file is created if it doesn't exist.
The connection is properly closed when the application exits.
Remember to call db.close() when you're completely done with the database, typically when your application is closing.

Would you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail?

This code is far to complicated I need a much simpler solution


I apologize for the complexity. You're right, we can simplify this significantly. Let's create a more straightforward solution that still maintains a single database connection across multiple uses.


Simple SQLite Database Class
Click to open code
This simplified Database class provides a much more straightforward solution. Here's how it works:

We use a class variable _connection to store the SQLite connection.
The get_connection class method creates a connection if one doesn't exist, or returns the existing connection.
The close_connection class method closes the connection when you're done with the database.
To use this in your desktop application:

python

Copy
# To get a connection (creates one if it doesn't exist)
conn = Database.get_connection("path/to/your/database.db")

# Use the connection
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)")
conn.commit()

# Later in the application or in another session
conn = Database.get_connection("path/to/your/database.db")
# This will return the same connection object

# When you're done with the database (e.g., when closing the application)
Database.close_connection()
This approach ensures that:

Only one database connection is created and reused.
The implementation is simple and easy to understand.
You can easily get the same connection throughout your application.
Remember to call Database.close_connection() when your application is closing to properly clean up the database connection.

Is this simpler approach more in line with what you were looking for? Would you like me to explain any part of it further?
